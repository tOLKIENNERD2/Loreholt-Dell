                <h2>A Lore Rhyme of The Dwarves</h2>
                <p>
                    The smooth mossberry<br>
                    And ye shall not tarry<br>
                    <br>
                    The emerald tree's apples<br>
                    for the breath that rattles<br>
                    <br>
                    When traveling in dire cold<br>
                    The blue blaze of the ice-wold<br>
                    <br>
                    For weakening wounds or tiring work<br>
                    The ferns that under stones do lurk<br>
                    <br>
                    As the lake washes the shore<br>
                    The water fern will restore<br>
                    <br>
                    To ye a wondrous new vigor<br>
                    When weary from the season's rigor
                </p>

                <h2>The Woldgarth of the Emerald Glens</h2>
                <p>
                    When Baer the bold was lord<br>
                    Rigant of the glens, the reward<br>
                    Of his folk, he kept in no hoard<br>
                    <br>
                    But dealt in justness his gold.<br>
                    One day he hunted on the wold<br>
                    That lay above his hold<br>
                    <br>
                    Through weald and fern's fen<br>
                    He came to a darkling den.<br>
                    He found his quarry, that glen<br>
                    <br>
                    It harbored a wolf with deeds<br>
                    So black and dire. The meads<br>
                    he haunted. Baer amongst the reeds<br>
                    <br>
                    Laid him down and dreamed<br>
                    Of bears a dancing where streamed<br>
                    a brook under hill that gleamed<br>
                    <br>
                    He built upon that hill<br>
                    A fort that stands still<br>
                    Aside the running rill<br>
                    <br>
                    As mountain stands long<br>
                    So shall stand his stead
                </p>

                <h2>The Craftsfolk of Tal-Tormind</h2>
                <p>
                    The folk of mountain lone<br>
                    They carved scenes of yore<br>
                    On countless walls of stone.<br>
                    The bird, the bear, and boar<br>
                    <br>
                    They emblazoned pon doors.<br>
                    The smiths they worked the gold<br>
                    and silver bright. The cores<br>
                    of jewels they shaped and rolled<br>
                    <br>
                    As wind upon the stone<br>
                    The masons struck and ground.<br>
                    The folk of mountain lone<br>
                    with polished wood, bound
